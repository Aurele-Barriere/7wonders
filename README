Aurèle Barrière & Nathan Thomasset
7 colors game
ARCSYS 2 


TO DO:
- finish report
- more strategies?
- asbstract maximisation strategy -> maybe not useful



FIXED:
- make tournaments -> see below
- the game doesn't end on a draw -> should be corrected
- when doing tournaments, the same result happens again and again for a while. why? maybe the initialization of random with time. -> that was it. fixed
- hegemony amelioration -> starve is good
