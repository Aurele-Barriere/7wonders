Aurèle Barrière & Nathan Thomasset
7 colors game
ARCSYS 2 


TO DO:
- hegemony amelioration
- write report
- more strategies
- asbstract maximisation strategy


FIXED:
- make tournaments -> see below
- the game doesn't end on a draw -> should be corrected
- when doing tournaments, the same result happens again and again for a while. why? maybe the initialization of random with time. -> that was it. fixed
